# Neuron Single Cell Analysis Tool

This is a tool aim to have better python accessability to the data presented in the academic paper [Dataset of human medial temporal lobe single neuron activity during declarative memory encoding and recognition.](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201810)

An example of how to use this tool can be found in [this notebook](https://github.com/andylikescodes/neuron_research_project/blob/master/example.ipynb).

A neuron decoding analysis for visual selective cells can be found in [this notebook](https://github.com/andylikescodes/neuron_research_project/blob/master/decoding_accuracy.ipynb).
